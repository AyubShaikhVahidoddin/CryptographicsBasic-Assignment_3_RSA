For Program Exceution: just execute the EXE The Name of EXE is **RSA_CRTTimingDiff_Implementation.exe**
and input any number and program will exceute the RSA and CRT and it give the output in above format with the 
Time taken for the execution for RSA and RSA With Cinese Reminder Theorem.

RSA encryption algorithm is one of the most powerful public key encryption algorithm. 
The problem with RSA algorithm is that RSA decryption is relatively slow in comparison to RSA encryption.
Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), a modulo based mathemati- cal theorem, is proposed by researchers as a way to enhance the performance of decryption. 
CRT minimizes the mathematical computation to large extent, thus improving the speed. CRT is well known for improving RSAâ€™s decryption speed.
